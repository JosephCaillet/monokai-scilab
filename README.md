![monokai for scilab screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JosephCaillet/monokai-scilab/master/screenshot-monokai-scilab.png)

## Install instruction
You first need to find/open your preference file.
For me, on GNU/Linux, it is here:

`/home/USER_NAME/.Scilab/scilab-5.5.2/XConfiguration.xml`

Search for the color section, an replace it with the one at line 288 in the XConfiguration.xml file from this repository.
